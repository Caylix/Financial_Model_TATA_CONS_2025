Key Components:
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

Relative Valuation (Multiples-Based)
Uses comparable company analysis (EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue, P/E) to estimate fair value per share based on sector peer benchmarks.

WACC & Beta Modelling
Calculates the weighted average cost of capital using bottom-up beta (from peer companies), capital structure targets, and market data inputs.

Altman Z-Score
Evaluates the companyâ€™s financial health and bankruptcy risk using the Altman Z-Score model.

DuPont Analysis (3-Way)
Breaks down ROE into profitability, efficiency, and leverage to analyze drivers of shareholder returns.
